# Global-Terrorism-Database
Global Terrorism Database visualization app using R shiny

**Introduction:**
This Shiny web application provides interactive visualization and analysis of the Global Terrorism Database. Users can explore terrorism incidents globally, filter data by region, country, and year, and visualize key insights through maps, charts, and summary tables.

**Features:**
1. **Map:** We can visualize terrorism incidents on an interactive map, showing locations, severity, and details of each event.
2. **Charts:** We can explore trends in terrorism incidents over the selected years, including deaths, injuries, and attack types.
3. **Summary:** View a summary table of filtered data, providing detailed information on terrorism incidents based on user selections.

**Instructions:**
1. **Select Region:** Choose a region from the dropdown menu to filter terrorism data.
2. **Select Country:** After selecting a region, choose a specific country to further refine the data.
3. **Select Year Range:** Use the slider to specify the range of years for analysis.
4. **Map:** View the geographic distribution of terrorism incidents by region and country.
5. **Charts:** Explore trends in terrorism incidents through interactive bar and line charts.
6. **Summary:** Review a summary table of filtered data, displaying key information on terrorism incidents.
